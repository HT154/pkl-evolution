= Pkl Evolution

This repository hosts Suggested Pkl Improvement, Change, or Enhancements (SPICE) for improving the Pkl language, tooling, and ecosystem.

This repository serves two purposes:

* To allow the Pkl language team to work on language changes and features.
* To solicit and accept feedback from the Pkl community.

== Contributing a SPICE

Writing a SPICE is a lot of work.
Avoid doing such work for nothing; if you would like to propose a SPICE, always start by submitting a topic to our link:https://github.com/apple/pkl/discussions[discussions] forum.
Once there is consensus there, a SPICE can be submitted.

== Process

The process for a SPICE is:

1. The SPICE is authored, and submitted as a pull request.
2. The pull request is reviewed, and either approved or rejected.
3. The status of the SPICE is updated, and the pull request is merged.

== Pkl language team

The Pkl language team consists of (in alphabetical order):

* Dan Chao (link:https://github.com/bioball[@bioball])
* Islon Scherer (link:https://github.com/stackoverflow[@stackoverflow])
* Philip HÃ¶lzenspies (link:https://github.com/holzensp[@holzensp])
